# Stocks_prediction_using_neural_network
 The Stocks Prediction Using Neural Network is a data-driven project that employs neural networks to forecast stock prices. This project uses historical stock data, market indicators, and other relevant features to train the neural network model. The goal is to predict future stock prices accurately, aiding investors in making informed decisions.
## Overview
The Stocks Prediction Using Neural Network is a data-driven project aimed at forecasting stock prices using the power of neural networks. By utilizing historical stock data, market indicators, and other relevant features, the project trains a neural network model to predict future stock prices accurately. The predictions generated by this model can assist investors in making informed decisions and formulating effective investment strategies.

## Key Steps and Components
+ Data Collection: Gather historical stock data, market indicators, and relevant features for training the neural network.
+ Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and normalizing numerical variables.
+ Feature Selection: Identify essential features that influence stock price movements.
+ Neural Network Model: Implement and configure a neural network architecture for stock price prediction.
+ Model Training: Train the neural network using the preprocessed data to learn the complex patterns and relationships in the historical stock data.
+ Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
+ Stocks Prediction: Deploy the trained neural network model to forecast future stock prices based on new data.
